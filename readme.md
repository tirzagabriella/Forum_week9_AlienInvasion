## Introduction
In Alien invasion, we must destroy the alien to receive a points. When the game starts, there is a ship in the bottom center. We can use arrow keys to move the ship left or right, and use space bar to shoot the bullets. When the bullets hit the alien, you got a points. But, if any alien hits the ship or reach the bottom of the screen, you will lose a ships. There are three chances (three ships), if the player loses three ships, then the games end.
